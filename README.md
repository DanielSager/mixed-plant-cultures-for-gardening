# mixed-plant-cultures-for-gardening
This code is a proposal for an algorithm to search the best combinations for plants in a garden, regarding the principles of polycultures.
The weakness is that it's actuall a very slow algorithm, because it checks all permutations, which can be builded with the input plants.
Maybe somebody with more knowledge in evolutionary algorithms could help.
