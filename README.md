# mixed-plant-cultures-for-gardening
This code is a proposal for an algorithm, which helps you find the best combinations of plants in a garden regarding the principles of polycultures.
The weakness is that it's actuall a very slow and quickly overloaded algorithm, because it checks all permutations, which can be builded with the input plants.
Maybe somebody could help to fix this?
